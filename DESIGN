Project Idea: Texas Hold'em Poker

Project Description:
Our project is a simulation of a game of Texas Hold'em poker. Players will be able
to create a game, and other players on different computers can run the program and
join the game.

User Interface:
The game will be displayed entirely in the terminal. Upon running the server program,
the user can create a game. When creating a game, the user must set the number of
players, set the number of hands to play for, and set the name of the game. Once
enough players have joined, the game will begin, with players being given a set
amount of money. To join, one must run the client program and put in the name of
the game they're trying to join. The game must also be open. During a particular
hand, the player will be shown their money, their hole cards, the community cards
as they're dealt, and a prompt to either bet or fold.

Technical Design:
    - Topics:
        1) networking: users on different computers will need to connect to a server
        2) working with files: records of each game will be stored in a file
        3) allocating memory: different information will need to be stored between functions
        4) processes/signals/semaphores: used for networking
    - Data structures:
        Structs will be needed to represent cards and to store player information
    - Algorithms:
        - analyze hands and determine who wins a given round
        - handle multiple users and user communication
    - Work Distribution:
