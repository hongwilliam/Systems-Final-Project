Systems Pd 4 Final Project Design Document
Group Members: Anthony Hom, Jake Goldman, William Hong
Project Idea: Texas Hold'em Poker

What we need:
shared memory, networking, signals, semaphores, sockets

Project description: Simulate a game of Texas hold em poker in the terminal
-Each player connects to a server
-What is displayed in each player's terminal:
1) Current hand
2) Money total
3) Cards being displayed
4) Prompt for betting/folding
-Different clients from different machines all connect to one main server
-Once you join server, you choose whether to join or create a game
-If you create a game, set the number of players in the game and presets number of hands
-If you want to join a game, join the server
-Game will start and everyone will be dealt their hand and see the river
-First, we will begin with a default preset amount of money per player
-Later on, we might implement a file system in which amount of money is kept track in a file
-Handle players who leave prematurely (Ctrl-C terminal)

Data structures: card struct for value and suit, array of structs for deck, keep track of clients (players)
Timeline: <to be filled in later>
