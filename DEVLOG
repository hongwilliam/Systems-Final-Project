1/2/18 - Established gameplay basics such as how to represent cards and hands
Cards are structs with two elements - value and suit

Time in between: took notes for networking lessons

1/9/18 - Discussed how to improve on established ideas such as how to shuffle and deal
We came up with idea in which 52 random ints are distributed once to each player
and each int will be converted to a corresponding card based on the ranking

1/13/18 - Refined the card representation system in which 1 is 3 of diamonds, 2 is 3 of clubs, etc
Fixed the code to make it cleaner and added the following essential aspects
(1) - finalized representation of cards as (ex: 48 - "A of Spades")
(2) - shuffling the deck
(3) - dealing the cards to 4 even hands
(4) - display the cards in each hand

1/15/18 - Discussed things to add later for gameplay aspect
(1) - Displaying the cards in a hand in order
(2) - Comparing singles, doubles, and combos (very intensive part)
(3) - Determining which player has the turn and implement the actual playing cards/passing

1/15/18 - Began pseudocode for networking

1/16/18 - Added pseudocode and ideas on how to compare combos
DISPLAYING THE HAND IN SORTED ORDER NOW WORKS!!!
Added makefile, will definitely be changed later once we add more files

1/17/18 - Added functions to check if 5 cards played make a combo and compare combos of same type to each other!
What we need to add: compare combos of different types to each other

1/18/18 - Added function to compare combos of different types to each other
What we need to add: now we need to start the actual gameplay such as keeping track of turns, selecting cards from hand

1/19/18 - Function headers to each function in the game setup file... all the basic mechanics are implemented!
What we need to add: NETWORKING, advanced gameplay mechanics - (keeping track of turns, choosing to play cards from hands or pass,
representing a pile of most recent cards played)

1/22/18 - Added functions to check the win condition and to check which player will go first.

1/23/18 - Added a player ID to indicate whose turn it is. This will help in checking which player starts.
Also refined the win condition and check start function.
check_win_condition function was changed to an int type.

1/25/18 - Set up basic networking

1/25/18 - Added a function that returns the string of every player's hand so that it can be modified for the purpose of the game.
Cleaned up code.
