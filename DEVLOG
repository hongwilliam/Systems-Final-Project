1/2/18 - Established gameplay basics such as how to represent cards and hands
Cards are structs with two elements - value and suit

Time in between: took notes for networking lessons

1/9/18 - Discussed how to improve on established ideas such as how to shuffle and deal
We came up with idea in which 52 random ints are distributed once to each player
and each int will be converted to a corresponding card based on the ranking

1/13/18 - Refined the card representation system in which 1 is 3 of diamonds, 2 is 3 of clubs, etc
Fixed the code to make it cleaner and added the following essential aspects
(1) - finalized representation of cards as (ex: 48 - "A of Spades")
(2) - shuffling the deck
(3) - dealing the cards to 4 even hands
(4) - display the cards in each hand

1/15/18 - Discussed things to add later for gameplay aspect
(1) - Displaying the cards in a hand in order
(2) - Comparing singles, doubles, and combos (very intensive part)
(3) - Determining which player has the turn and implement the actual playing cards/passing
Note that Jakes is currently working and reading on networking aspect which will be implemented after gameplay is finalized

1/16/18 - Added pseudocode and ideas on how to compare combos
